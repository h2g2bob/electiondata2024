# ONS Output Areas

We can map output areas to wards.

## Why

Output Areas are approximately the same size, in terms of population.

Ward boundaries change over time, so we can calulate...

- We have election results for (old) wards, so can guess the political
  leanings of each ward and the output areas it contained (at the time)
- We know the wards, and therefore the output areas, of the new
  constituencies, so can apply our guesses per OA to the constituency.

## Example

Taffs Well changed `ward_id`:

```
sqlite> select * from ward_to_blah where ward_name like 'Taff%';
ward_id    ward_name    westminster_id  westminster_name  lower_id   lower_name         upper_id   upper_name         years
---------  -----------  --------------  ----------------  ---------  -----------------  ---------  -----------------  --------------
W05000691  Taffs Well   W07000075       Pontypridd        W06000016  Rhondda Cynon Taf  W06000016  Rhondda Cynon Taf  2018,2019,2020
W05001103  Taff's Well  W07000075       Pontypridd        W06000016  Rhondda Cynon Taf  W06000016  Rhondda Cynon Taf  2022
```

But all the OA stayed the same, so we can tell these are the same place:

```
sqlite> select * from ons_oa_to_ward where ward_id in ('W05000691', 'W05001103');
oa21cd     ward_id  
---------  ---------
